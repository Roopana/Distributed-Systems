A distributed system in its most simplest definition is a group of computers working together as to appear as a single computer to the end-user.

These machines have a shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole systemâ€™s uptime. [Ref](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c/)
